Data Analysis and Visualization of 5-Star Hotel Performance
Overview
This project analyzes key performance metrics for a selection of 5-star hotels using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into revenue, occupancy, and other critical metrics across properties in multiple cities. This tool helps in identifying trends, comparing property performance, and understanding customer booking behaviors.

Project Objectives
Visualize hotel performance across key metrics: Revenue, RevPAR (Revenue Per Available Room), ADR (Average Daily Rate), and occupancy percentage.
Facilitate quick comparisons between different cities and hotel properties.
Identify trends and patterns over time and across different booking platforms.
Dataset
The dataset includes information on hotel properties such as:

Properties: Names and locations of hotels (e.g., Atliq Grands in Delhi, Atliq Exotica in Mumbai).
Metrics: Revenue, RevPAR, occupancy rate, ADR, and booking patterns.
Filters: City-based segmentation, weekday/weekend performance, booking platforms, and weekly trends.
Key Visualizations
Revenue Trends by Week - Visualizes weekly revenue changes and patterns across various hotel categories.
Occupancy Rate by Category - Provides a clear view of occupancy trends segmented by business and luxury categories.
Realization % and ADR by Booking Platform - Compares ADR and booking realization across online and offline platforms.
Comparative Metrics (REVPAR, ADR, Occupancy) - Showcases core metrics over time, allowing easy analysis of high-performing and low-performing weeks.
Insights
Revenue Patterns: Weekly revenue analysis helps identify peak periods.
Booking Insights: Analysis across booking platforms shows trends in customer preferences.
Occupancy & ADR: Helps reveal the correlation between occupancy rates and average daily rate across properties.
Technical Tools
Power BI: Used to build interactive and responsive dashboards for data analysis and visualization.
